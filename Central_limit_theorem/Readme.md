Notebook containing a brief explaination about what central limit theorem is 
and (easy for anyone to play around) simulation of central limit theorem over various population distributions.

Directions for using the simulation:

Use the below intuitive and easy to adjust levers, to see the histogram get plotted for the sampling distribution 
as well as validate Central limit theorem
1. Population Distribution selection from drop down
2. Sample size and no of samples from sliders
3. No of bins in the output histogram from slider
