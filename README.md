# DS_n_Stats

This repo includes a collection of codes dealing with:
1. Forecasting [Forecasting.ipynb]: This notebook comprises of a full fledged forecasting model and the analysis behind the development. It also includes primers on analysing
ACF, PACF plots
2. ML code development from scratch [RandomForest_from_scratch.py, Linear_n_logisitic_regression_from_scratch.py]: As the names indicate, these scripts contain
codes for randomforest, linear regression (including ridge), logistic regression developed from scratch using numpy.
3. Image compression [image_compression_through_svd_n_clustering.ipynb]: Codes for interesting, simple yet elegant ways to compress image using Kmeans and SVD
4. Analysis of large data through spark (News_data_analysis_through_spark[part_of_academic_course].html): 
  Codes developed as a group to analyze large US news data. Developed on spark on databricks. This was part of my academic course.
5. Visualizations [Viz_EDA.ipynb]: A crisp notebook containing matlplotlib, seaborn based interesting yet insighful visualizations on few datasets.
6. Statistical_distributions.ipynb: A short overview of important fundamental statistical distributions.
7. Central Limit theorem: A simulation of the central limit theorem.
