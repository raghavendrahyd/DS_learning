# Introduction
This repo includes a collection of codes dealing with:
#### 1. Forecasting [Forecasting.ipynb]: 
This notebook comprises of a full fledged forecasting model and the analysis behind the development. It also includes primers on analysing
ACF, PACF plots
#### 2. ML code development from scratch:
As the names indicate, these scripts contain
codes for Decision trees, randomforest, linear regression (including ridge), logistic regression, Boosting (adaboost as well as Gradboost), KMeans and spectral clustering developed from scratch using numpy.
#### 3. Image compression [image_compression_through_svd_n_clustering.ipynb]: 
Codes for interesting, simple yet elegant ways to compress image using Kmeans and SVD
#### 4. Analysis of large data through spark (News_data_analysis_through_spark[part_of_academic_course].html):
Codes developed as a group to analyze large US news data. Developed on spark on databricks. This was part of my academic course.
#### 5. Visualizations [Viz_EDA.ipynb]: 
A crisp notebook containing matlplotlib, seaborn based interesting yet insighful visualizations on few datasets.
#### 6. Statistical_distributions.ipynb: 
A short overview of important fundamental statistical distributions.
#### 7. Central Limit theorem: 
A simulation of the central limit theorem.
#### 8. Linear reg model building[linear_reg_model_building.ipynb]: 
Building a linear reg model along with analysis and model selection. This was part of my academic course.
#### 9. Clustering.ipynb:
A notebook various clustering methods, their analysis, implementation, and evaluation metrics of clustering.
#### 9. Feature selection and importance.ipynb:
A notebook talking about various feature selection and importance techniques including LIME, SHAP, feature importance in random forest, and mRMR.
